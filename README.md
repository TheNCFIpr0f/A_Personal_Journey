The story of my life

Becoming a professor for the NCFI Advanced course has been one of the most fulfilling journeys of my life. I remember my early days in the field, combing through digital evidence, feeling the weight of responsibility as I uncovered truths hidden within bytes and bits. Teaching this course allows me to share not just the technical skills, but the deep sense of purpose behind every investigation.

Each student brings their unique passion, eager to learn, not just to solve puzzles, but to protect the vulnerable and hold the guilty accountable. Watching them grow from novices into experts, capable of outsmarting cybercriminals and recovering vital data, is incredibly rewarding.

It’s not just about teaching the latest forensic techniques—it's about instilling the ethics, patience, and relentless curiosity that make a true investigator. There are long nights, moments of frustration, but when a student cracks a complex challenge or masters a difficult concept, I’m reminded of why I chose this path.

The NCFI isn’t just a course; it’s a mission. It’s a privilege to guide these future guardians of digital justice, knowing they’ll go on to make the world a safer place.
